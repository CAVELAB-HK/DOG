# Quadruped RL from Scratch - Learning Path

## Course Overview
This guide will teach you how to train a Unitree Go1 quadruped robot to walk using reinforcement learning, starting from zero robotics knowledge.

## Learning Path
1. **MuJoCo Basics** - Understanding the physics simulator
2. **Robot Kinematics** - How robot joints and coordinates work
3. **Gymnasium Environments** - Creating RL training environments
4. **Observation & Action Spaces** - What the robot senses and controls
5. **Reward Engineering** - Teaching the robot what we want
6. **RL Algorithms** - PPO and how it learns
7. **Training Loop** - Putting it all together
8. **Advanced Topics** - Curriculum learning, domain randomization

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- High school physics (forces, torques, velocities)
- Basic linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
- Willingness to experiment!

## What You'll Build
By the end, you'll have:
- A custom Gym environment for the Go1 robot
- A trained policy that makes the robot walk
- Understanding of every component in the system
